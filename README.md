# Module-12-UFOs

# Overview
The reason we did this project was so that we could learn how to set up and add elements of a bisic website. We were able to add a rough design and add tables of data with filters into it. 

# Results

we used thie new website so that we had an easy way to build and share our table of ufo sitings. building the table with filters made it much easier to see where everything was happening. 

### filters broken down
date- we used the date to look when they happened

city- we used this to see what city they happened in, bonita was the place holder in a light gray

state- To look to see if they are in your state. Cali is the place holder.

country- to check to see if your country has sitings. idk if ive heard of sitings outside of the us.

shape- so you can see if there are other sitings of a similar type by starship shape.

# Summary
the new site works awesome and will be used to help you search through the hundreds of examples of sitings.  Its a simple site that is decently clean and is easy to reproduce and design. 

one thing to add would be a clear filter button that auto refreshes everything. also maybe filters over the table titles, example over date so you could see the most recent or oldest ones.
